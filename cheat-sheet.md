An overview of the *git strucuture* can be taken from the above picture. We can simply derive from it that there are 4 distinct blocks:
- working files (our local working directory)
- staging area (the changes we want to add to our repository)
- local repository (a local environment where we track all our file changes)
- remote repository (a remote environment that can be available for other users)
